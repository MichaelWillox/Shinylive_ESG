# Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Tool

<https://michaelwillox.github.io/Shinylive_ESG>

This prototype ESG tool was developed using synthetic (fictional) data to demonstrate how a web app could be used to generate reports for individual businesses, providing them with relevant information on their ESG performance relative to their peers. Its purpose is to encourage the use of standard, transparent and reproducible ESG indicators.

There are many standards or frameworks relating to ESG. This is a challenge, as there are no common standards that have emerged yet. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are some of the most common frameworks used by enterprises to report on their ESG performance. 

This tool shows three examples of basic ESG indicators: a social indicator, employee age; an environmental indicator, 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per employee; and a governance indicator, the percentage of female board members.

Users can enter their specific information in the fields on the left, including the following:

 - Province or territory,
 - Industry,
 - A unique business ID,
 - The total amount of greenhouse gas emissions per year is
 - Businesses' total number of employees,
 - Number of board members, and
 - Number of female board members.
 
 As an illustrative example, users are encouraged to test the app with the values
 below or choose their own.
